# Scaffold JS

Version 2 of Scaffold [WIP]

# Why choose Angular?

I would encourage all developers to do their own research before choosing a framework but these are some of my own reasons.

- Latest Web Standards
- Cross Platform
- Full framework not just view logic
- Legacy browser support
- Performance
- It's what the cool kids are using ;)

# Features
- Angular 2 https://angular.io
