# Scaffold JS

The web changes a lot in a year! 

**Note:** Angular 2 is in Beta right now. Things can and probably will be refactored later.

Scaffold V2 is completely re-written from the ground up to use Angular 2 and it's typescript approach as well as harnessing Ionic 2.
The project aims to follow best practices in frontend web development with a component based approach, comprehensive testing (Unit and Behavioural). The optimization of frontend assets through the proven techniques of concatentation. minification and compression. Configurations are also included to allow you to easily set up a docker container and provision all of your necessary dependencies. It will also aim to maintain and expand upon many of the techniques used in V1. 

This project will be published as an NPM module and Yeoman generator to allow for modularity and reusability. The generator will contain options for customizing the architecture of your application.
